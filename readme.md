## Intro

I like cli tools **very** much and I try to make my workflow as much terminal based as possible.
This repo helps me keep track of all my dotfiles, scripts, system wide configs.

## Requirements

### Distribution

The **dotfiles**,**kernel** and **scripts** folders are distribution-independent however the **portage** and **overlay** 
directories are for Gentoo-based system.

### Shell

- zsh
- tmux
- elinks
- GNU coreutils

### Editor

- vim fr,de,en spellfiles
- omnicppcomplete

### Mail

- neomutt
- notmuch
- isync
- msmtp

### Misc

- diff-so-fancy for git https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy
- fzy the c version of fzf for some scripts https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy

## Installation

It is preferred to place the ultraconf folder to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME then the script ultraconf.sh can be run to install dotfiles.
